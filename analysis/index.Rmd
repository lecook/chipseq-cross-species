# Workflow and analysis of comparative craniofacial ChIP-seq work in the fat-tailed dunnart and mouse

This project involves a number of analysis for the generation of ChIP-seq data for the fat-tailed dunnart for comparison with the exisiting mouse data in ENCODE.

## Data

## Data preparation

* [Dunnart data pre-processing](dunnart_data_processing.html)

* [Mouse data pre-processing]

## Analyses:

* Whole genome alignment between mouse and dunnart

* Dunnart peak characterisation

* [Cross-species peak comparisons](cross-species-peak-comparison.html)

	+ Peak level
	
	+ Gene level
	
	+ Incorporating temporal mouse gene expression data

This project involves a number of analysis for the generation of ChIP-seq data for the fat-tailed dunnart for comparison with the exisiting mouse data in ENCODE.

Data:

Data preparation:
- Dunnart data 
	- Read alignment
	- Aligned read filtering
	- Peak calling
- Mouse data 
	- Aligned read filtering
	- Peak calling

Analyses:
- Whole genome alignment between mouse and dunnart
- Dunnart peak characterisation
- [Cross-species peak comparisons](cross-species-peak-comparison.html)
	- Peak level
	- Gene level
- Incorporating temporal mouse gene expression data

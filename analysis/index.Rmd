This project involves a number of analysis for the generation of ChIP-seq data for the fat-tailed dunnart for comparison with the exisiting mouse data in ENCODE.

# Data:



# Data preparation:
## [Dunnart data pre-processing](dunnart_data_processing.html)
## [Mouse data pre-processing]

# Analyses:
## Whole genome alignment between mouse and dunnart
## Dunnart peak characterisation
## [Cross-species peak comparisons](cross-species-peak-comparison.html)
### Peak level
### Gene level
### Incorporating temporal mouse gene expression data
